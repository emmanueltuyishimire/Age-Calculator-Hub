    {
        question: "What is an annuity payout?",
        answer: "An annuity payout is a series of regular payments made to you from a lump-sum investment (your principal). This is often used for retirement income. This calculator helps you understand what those payouts might be or how long they might last."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between 'Fixed Length' and 'Fixed Payment' mode?",
        answer: "'Fixed Length' mode calculates how much you can withdraw periodically if you want the annuity to last for a specific number of years. 'Fixed Payment' mode calculates how many years your annuity will last if you withdraw a fixed amount periodically."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the interest rate affect my payout?",
        answer: "A higher interest or return rate means your remaining principal will grow faster, which will result in either a higher payout amount over the same period or a longer payout duration for the same payment amount."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this calculator a substitute for financial advice?",
        answer: "No. This tool is for informational purposes only and provides a simplified estimate. Annuities can be complex financial products. You should always consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions."
