                           When you make your regular monthly payment on a loan, a large portion goes toward interest, especially in the early years. An extra payment, however, goes directly toward reducing your principal balance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           By reducing the principal, you reduce the amount of interest that accrues in the following months. This creates a snowball effect, accelerating your payoff date and significantly reducing the total amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan.
