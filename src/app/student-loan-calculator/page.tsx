    {
        question: "How is a student loan payment calculated?",
        answer: "It's calculated using an amortization formula based on the loan balance, interest rate, and repayment term. Our Simple Student Loan Calculator can find this for you if you provide the other three values."
    },
    {
        question: "How can I pay off my student loans faster?",
        answer: "Making extra payments is the most effective way. Even a small additional amount reduces the principal, which in turn reduces the total interest you pay over time. Our Repayment Calculator is designed to show you this exact impact."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a grace period?",
        answer: "A grace period is a set amount of time after you graduate or leave school before you have to start making payments. For federal loans, this is typically six months. Interest may still accrue during this time, which is what our Projection Calculator models."
    },
    {
        question: "Should I pay interest while in school?",
        answer: "If you have unsubsidized loans, interest will accrue while you're in school. Paying that interest as it accrues prevents it from being capitalized (added to your principal balance) when you enter repayment. This can save you a significant amount of money in the long run."
