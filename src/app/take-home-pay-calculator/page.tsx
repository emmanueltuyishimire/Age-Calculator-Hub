const faqs = [
    {
        question: "How is my take-home pay calculated?",
        answer: "Your take-home pay (net pay) is your gross salary minus all deductions. This calculator estimates your federal income tax withholding based on the new W-4 form, FICA taxes (Social Security & Medicare), and any state/local taxes, as well as pre-tax deductions like 401(k) and health insurance."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between deductions withheld by my employer and other deductions?",
        answer: "'Pre-tax deductions withheld' (like 401k or health insurance) are taken from your paycheck before taxes are calculated. 'Other deductions' (like traditional IRA contributions) are not taken from your paycheck but still reduce your annual taxable income."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between a deduction and a credit?",
        answer: "A deduction reduces your taxable income, lowering your tax bill based on your tax bracket. A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your actual tax liability. This calculator factors in the Child Tax Credit and credit for other dependents."
    },
    {
        question: "How does checking the '2+ jobs' box affect my calculation?",
        answer: "It uses a different calculation method suggested by the IRS for the W-4 form (Step 2c) to ensure more accurate withholding for people with multiple sources of income, preventing a large tax bill at the end of the year."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this calculator a substitute for professional tax advice?",
        answer: "No. This calculator provides a detailed estimate for informational purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional tax software or advice from a certified tax preparer. Tax laws are complex, and you should consult a professional for your specific situation."
