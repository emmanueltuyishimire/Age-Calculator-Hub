                        <p>A vehicle cash rebate is an additional deduction on the purchase price of a car. The amounts generally range between a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. In some cases, the rebate is large enough to cover the entire down payment.</p>
                        <p>Aside from vehicle rebates available to any potential buyer, there can be special rebates such as those for people who served in the military, current students, or first-time buyers. Some dealers may require the financing of the auto loan for a car purchase to be done through a captive lender in order to qualify for a rebate.</p>
                        <p>Several states in the U.S. view cash rebates as payments from auto manufacturers. For example, the purchase of a vehicle at $30,000 with a cash rebate of $2,000 will have sales tax calculated based on $30,000, not $28,000. Luckily, many states do not tax cash rebates; these states are Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Wyoming.</p>

                    <CardContent className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
                        <p>When car buyers receive more favorable interest rates than usual on their car purchases, this is called low-interest financing. A car loan at a lower rate will require the car buyer to pay less in interest during the life of the loan. In some cases, the low rate only applies to a brief introductory period. The calculator will not work for car loans where the low financing only applies to a limited period.</p>
                        <p>While cash rebates tend to be more widely available, low-interest financing is generally reserved for a select few. Normally, these car buyers (what car ads often refer to as "well-qualified buyers") must have excellent credit scores to qualify. In some cases, they must also make larger down payments.</p>

                       <p>Even when dealers offer their lowest interest rate financing, there is no guarantee that it is the best possible rate available to car buyers, especially if their credit scores are on the lower end. It can be helpful to shop around at external sources such as banks, credit unions, and online auto loan companies. Getting pre-approved before going to the dealer will give you a rate you can compare to their low-interest financing option.</p>
                       <p>Remember, the final transaction price on a car is still negotiable unless stated otherwise. The calculator computes hard figures to arrive at the best financial choice, but remember to consider other factors. For example, someone with poorer credit may need to consider the cash rebate option for an immediate financial need.</p>
