                        <p>In the U.S., an annuity is a contract for a fixed sum of money usually paid by an insurance company to an investor in a stream of cash flows over a period of time, typically as a means of saving for retirement. In many cases, this sum is paid annually over the duration of the investor's life. The investor, or annuity owner, is usually the policyholder and is often also the annuitant (the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) of the annuity whose life expectancy and age are used to determine the terms of the annuity). The owner controls incidents of ownership in the annuity, has the right to the cash surrender value, and can also assign the policy and make withdrawals. Insurance companies that offer annuities pay a specific amount over a predetermined period of time either as an immediate annuity (beginning immediately) or as a deferred annuity (after an accumulation phase). Earnings in annuities grow and compound, tax-deferred, which means that the payment of taxes is reserved for a future time.</p>
                        <p>Most people use annuities as supplemental investments in combination with other investments such as IRAs, 401(k)s, or other pension plans. Many people find that as they get older, investment options with tax shields approach or reach their contribution limits. As a result, conservative investment options can be sparse, and buying an annuity can be a viable alternative. Annuities can also be helpful for those seeking to diversify their retirement portfolios. The majority of annuity investments are made by investors looking to ensure that they are provided for later in life. In general, annuities make sense for some, but not all. It is important for each individual to evaluate their specific situations or consult professionals.</p>
                        <p>There are many different types of annuities, including tax-advantaged annuities, fixed or variable rate annuities, annuities that pay out a death benefit to families or last a lifetime, and more. Different annuities serve different purposes, and have pros and cons depending on an individual's situation.</p>

                        <p>Most annuities can be differentiated as fixed or variable annuities. However, there is a third category that is becoming increasingly common, called "indexed annuities," which combines aspects of both.</p>
                        <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground">Fixed Annuities</h4>
                        <p>Fixed annuities pay out a guaranteed amount after a certain date, and a return rate is largely dependent on market interest rates at the time the annuity contract is signed. Most do not have cost-of-living adjustments (COLA), and as a result, their real purchasing power may decline with time.</p>
                        <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Variable Annuities</h4>
                        <p>Unlike fixed annuities, variable annuities pay out a fluctuating amount based on the investment performance of assets (usually mutual funds) in an annuity. Variable annuities do not guarantee the return of principal.</p>
                        <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Indexed Annuities</h4>
                        <p>An indexed annuity combines aspects of both fixed and variable annuities. They pay out a guaranteed minimum such as a fixed annuity does, but a portion of it is also tied to the performance of the investments within.</p>

                        <p>Choosing between an immediate or deferred annuity is just as important as choosing between a fixed or variable annuity.</p>
                        <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground">Immediate Annuities</h4>
                        <p>An immediate annuity involves an upfront premium that is paid out from the principal fairly early, anywhere from as early as the next month to no later than a year after the initial premium is received. It primarily serves as a way to guarantee a fixed stream of predictable income for retirement.</p>
                         <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Deferred Annuities</h4>
                         <p>A deferred annuity is one that is built over time with tax shields. Usually, deposits are made over many years until a specific date at which the total is taken over by the annuity issuer and an income stream is provided. The advantage of a deferred annuity is that taxes on built capital are deferred. However, investors will need to wait until at least age 59 ½ or older before they can start the payout phase to avoid a 10% IRS penalty.</p>
