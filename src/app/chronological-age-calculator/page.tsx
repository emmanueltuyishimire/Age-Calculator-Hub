        question: "What is chronological age?",
        answer: "Chronological age is the most common measure of age, representing the exact amount of time that has passed from your date of birth to the present moment. It's expressed in years, months, and days."
    },
    {
        question: "How is chronological age calculated?",
        answer: "It is calculated by subtracting the date of birth from the current date (or another specified date). A precise calculation must account for the different number of days in months and for leap years, which our calculator does automatically."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this calculator free?",
        answer: "Yes, this chronological age calculator is a completely free online tool."
    },
    {
        question: "How does chronological age differ from biological age?",
        answer: "Chronological age is a fixed measure of time. <a href='/biological-age' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Biological age</a>, in contrast, is a measure of how well your body is functioning and can be influenced by lifestyle, genetics, and health factors."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is knowing my chronological age important?",
        answer: "It's essential for legal and official purposes, including applying for a driver's license, passport, or social security benefits, as well as for school enrollment and employment eligibility."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I calculate my age on a future date?",
        answer: "Yes. In the 'Age at the Date of' field, you can enter any future date to see how old you will be at that specific time."

                           Chronological age is the most straightforward and universally accepted measure of age. It represents the exact amount of time you have been alive since the moment you were born. This is the age that appears on your legal documents and is used to determine eligibility for societal rights and privileges, such as voting, driving, and retirement.
