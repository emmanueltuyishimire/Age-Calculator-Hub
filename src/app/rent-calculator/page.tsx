const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What is the 30% rule for rent?",
        answer: "The 30% rule is a popular financial guideline suggesting that you should spend no more than 30% of your gross (pre-tax) monthly income on rent. This helps ensure you have enough money for other expenses and savings."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you calculate affordable rent?",
        answer: "A common method is to divide your annual income by 40, which is roughly 30% of your monthly income. Our calculator refines this by also considering your existing debt payments to provide a more realistic budget."
    },
    {
        question: "Does 'monthly debt' include utilities or groceries?",
        answer: "No. For this calculation, 'monthly debt' should only include fixed debt payments like car loans, student loans, and minimum credit card payments. It does not include variable living expenses like utilities, groceries, or entertainment."
    },
    {
        question: "Why does my debt affect how much rent I can afford?",
        answer: "Lenders and landlords often look at your total debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. High monthly debt payments reduce the amount of income available for housing, so considering your debts gives you a more conservative and safer rent estimate."
