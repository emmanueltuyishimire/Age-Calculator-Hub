        question: "What is the formula for compound interest?",
        answer: "The basic formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the future value, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years."
    },
    {
        question: "How is compound interest different from simple interest?",
        answer: "Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount. Compound interest is calculated on the principal amount plus the accumulated interest from previous periods. This 'interest on interest' is what makes it so powerful."
    },
    {
        question: "Does compound interest work for debt too?",
        answer: "Yes, and it's why high-interest debt (like credit card debt) can be so dangerous. The interest you don't pay off gets added to your balance, and then you're charged interest on that larger balance, creating a cycle that's hard to break."

            Albert Einstein reportedly called compound interest the "eighth wonder of the world." While the quote's origin is debated, its sentiment is not. Compound interest is the single most powerful force in personal finance. Understanding and harnessing it is the key to building significant wealth over time.

          <Card className="my-8 bg-muted border-l-4 border-primary">
            <CardHeader><CardTitle>Interest on Your Interest</CardTitle></CardHeader>
            <CardContent>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    Simply put, compound interest is the interest you earn not only on your initial principal but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. Your money starts working for you, and then the money it earns also starts working for you, creating a snowball effect that can lead to exponential growth.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Simple vs. Compound Interest: A Quick Example</h2>
          <p>Imagine you invest $1,000 at a 10% annual rate for two years.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Simple Interest:</strong> You earn $100 in year one and another $100 in year two. Total interest: $200.</li>
            <li><strong>Compound Interest:</strong> You earn $100 in year one. In year two, you earn 10% on the new balance of $1,100, which is $110. Total interest: $210.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While $10 may not seem like much, this difference grows exponentially over decades.</p>

           <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Different Compounding Frequencies</h2>
           <p>
            Interest can compound on any given frequency schedule but will typically compound annually or monthly. The more frequently interest is compounded within a time period, the higher the interest will be earned. For example, a 6% APR compounded monthly results in an effective annual rate (APY) of 6.17%.

           <p>The most crucial ingredient for compound interest is **time**. Let's look at a simple example:</p>

            <p className="text-center text-3xl font-bold my-4">Saver A, the early starter, ends up with more money despite contributing only a third of the amount. That's the power of giving your money more time to compound.</p>
