        icon: Apple,
        title: "Eat a Nutrient-Dense, Anti-Inflammatory Diet", 
        description: "Focus on a diet rich in polyphenols and antioxidants from whole foods like leafy greens (spinach, kale), colorful berries, nuts, and seeds. These foods directly combat oxidative stress and inflammation, two primary drivers of cellular aging. Significantly reduce your intake of processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy trans fats, which promote 'inflammaging'." 
    },
    { 
        icon: Zap,
        title: "Prioritize Consistent and Varied Exercise", 
        description: "Combine at least 150 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercise (like brisk walking, swimming, or cycling) per week with 2-3 strength training sessions. Cardio improves heart health and circulation, while resistance training builds and maintains muscle mass, which is crucial for a high resting metabolism and a lower metabolic age. Don't forget flexibility and balance work." 
    },
    { 
        icon: Bed,
        title: "Master Your Sleep Hygiene", 
        description: "Aim for 7-9 hours of high-quality, uninterrupted sleep per night. During deep sleep, your body performs critical repair functions through autophagy, clears metabolic waste from the brain, and regulates essential hormones like cortisol and growth hormone. Poor sleep is a powerful accelerator of the aging process. Create a cool, dark, and quiet sleep environment." 
    },
    { 
        icon: Brain,
        title: "Actively Manage Chronic Stress", 
        description: "Chronic stress floods your body with cortisol, a hormone that accelerates telomere shortening and promotes inflammation. Incorporate daily stress-reduction techniques such as mindfulness meditation (apps like Calm or Headspace can help), deep-breathing exercises, yoga, or simply spending 20 minutes in nature. These practices can measurably lower cortisol levels." 
    },
    { 
        icon: Users,
        title: "Nurture Strong Social Connections", 
        description: "Meaningful social bonds are a powerful, often overlooked, factor in longevity and healthy aging. Strong relationships act as a buffer against stress, reduce feelings of isolation, and have been linked to a lower risk of dementia and a stronger immune system. Make time for friends, family, and community activities that bring you joy and a sense of belonging."

const faqs = [
    {
        question: "How quickly can I see a change in my biological age?",
        answer: "While long-term consistency is crucial, some studies have shown measurable improvements in epigenetic markers in as little as 8-12 weeks with intensive lifestyle changes. However, a more realistic timeframe to see significant, stable changes is 6-12 months. It's a marathon, not a sprint."
    },
    {
        question: "Which single habit has the biggest impact on lowering biological age?",
        answer: "While it's highly individual, consistent exercise that combines both cardiovascular and strength training is often cited as the most powerful intervention. Exercise impacts multiple aging pathways at once: it reduces inflammation, improves mitochondrial health, builds metabolically active muscle, and helps manage stress."
    },
    {
        question: "Is it ever too late to start trying to improve my biological age?",
        answer: "Absolutely not. The body has a remarkable capacity for repair and regeneration at any age. Studies on individuals in their 60s, 70s, and beyond have shown significant improvements in health markers, strength, and cognitive function after adopting healthier habits. The best time to start was yesterday, but the second-best time is right now."
    },
    {
        question: "Do supplements help in reducing biological age?",
        answer: "Some supplements, like Omega-3s (for inflammation), Vitamin D, and certain antioxidants, may support healthy aging. However, they should 'supplement' a healthy lifestyle, not replace it. A 'food-first' approach is always superior. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen."

            While you can't turn back your chronological clock, the exciting news from the field of geroscience is that your biological age is remarkably flexible. The daily choices you make have a profound and measurable impact on your cellular health, inflammation levels, and even how your genes are expressed. By adopting key, evidence-based habits, you can effectively slow down, halt, and in some cases even reverse your body's internal aging process.
