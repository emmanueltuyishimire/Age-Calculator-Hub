const faqs = [
    {
        question: "How can I increase my take-home pay?",
        answer: "You can potentially increase your take-home pay by adjusting your tax withholding (be careful not to under-withhold), contributing to pre-tax retirement accounts to lower your taxable income, or reviewing your benefits elections to see if there are more cost-effective options."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between a 401(k) and a Roth 401(k)?",
        answer: "A traditional 401(k) uses pre-tax dollars, lowering your taxable income now, but you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. A Roth 401(k) uses post-tax dollars, so there's no immediate tax break, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free."
    },
    {
        question: "Why are my paychecks different amounts sometimes?",
        answer: "This can happen due to overtime pay, bonuses, changes in your tax withholding, or adjustments to your benefits contributions. Always review your pay stub to understand any differences."
    },
    {
        question: "Is it better to get a bonus or a raise?",
        answer: "A raise increases your gross pay for all future pay periods and contributes to a higher base for retirement contributions. A bonus is a one-time payment. While a large bonus is great, a raise is generally better for your long-term financial health."

            Your paycheck is the cornerstone of your financial life, yet many of us don't fully understand what happens to our money between the 'gross pay' we earn and the 'net pay' we take home. Understanding the components of your pay stub is the first step toward effective budgeting, smart saving, and taking control of your financial future.

The difference between your gross and net pay is money that is working for you in other waysâ€”funding your retirement, paying for your health coverage, and contributing to public services.
