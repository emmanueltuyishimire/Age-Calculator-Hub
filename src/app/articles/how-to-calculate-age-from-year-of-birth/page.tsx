            Ever needed to get a quick estimate of someone's age without knowing their full birthday? Calculating age from just the year of birth is a common need, whether for filling out forms, historical research, or simple curiosity. It's a straightforward method that gives you a useful, though not exact, answer.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4">The Basic Formula for Calculating Age by Year</h2>
          <p>
            The formula to calculate age from the year of birth is as simple as it gets. You just need two pieces of information: the current year and the person's birth year.
          </p>

           <Card className="my-8 bg-muted">
                <CardHeader>
                    <CardTitle className="text-center">The Formula</CardTitle>
                </CardHeader>
                <CardContent className="text-center">
                    <p className="text-2xl font-mono p-4 bg-background rounded-md">
                        Age = Current Year - Birth Year
                    </p>
                </CardContent>
            </Card>

          <p>
            For example, if the current year is 2024 and someone was born in 1990, the calculation would be:
          </p>
           <p className="text-xl font-mono p-4 bg-background rounded-md text-center">
             2024 - 1990 = 34
          </p>
          <p>So, the person is approximately 34 years old.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4">When is This Method Useful?</h2>
           <p>
            Calculating age by year is perfect for situations where precision isn't critical. It's great for:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Quick Estimations:</strong> Getting a ballpark figure for someone's age in a casual conversation.</li>
            <li><strong>Demographic Data:</strong> Analyzing age groups in a population without needing exact birthdays.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical Figures:</strong> Estimating the age of a historical person at a specific point in time.</li>
          </ul>


          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4">The Limitations: Why It's Not Always Accurate</h2>
          <p>
            The main drawback of this simple formula is that it doesn't account for the month and day of birth. This means the calculated age could be off by one year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider our example of someone born in 1990. In 2024, they will be either 33 or 34 years old, depending on whether their birthday has already passed in the current year.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>If their birthday is in January and it's now March, they are indeed 34.</li>
            <li>If their birthday is in December and it's now March, they are still 33.</li>
          </ul>
           <p>
            The "Age = Current Year - Birth Year" formula gives you the age the person will be on their birthday in the current year. It doesn't tell you their current, exact age.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4">For Precision: Use a Full Date of Birth</h2>
          <p>
            For situations where accuracy is important, such as for legal documents, medical records, or official applications, you need to calculate age using the full date of birth (year, month, and day). This calculation subtracts the birth date from the current date, correctly accounting for all factors, including leap years.
          </p>
