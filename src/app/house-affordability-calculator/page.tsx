        question: "What is the 28/36 rule for mortgages?",
        answer: "The 28/36 rule is a common guideline used by lenders. It suggests that your monthly housing costs (principal, interest, taxes, insurance - PITI) should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income, and your total debt payments (including housing, car loans, etc.) should not exceed 36%."
    },
    {
        question: "How much income do I need to afford a $500,000 house?",
        answer: "It depends on many factors, including your down payment, interest rate, other debts, and the lender's requirements. Our calculator can give you a good estimate based on your specific financial situation."
    },
    {
        question: "Does 'monthly debt' include rent?",
        answer: "When calculating your Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio for a new home purchase, you do not include your current rent payment. You should include other long-term debts like car payments, student loans, and credit card minimum payments."
    },
    {
        question: "How much of a down payment should I make?",
        answer: "A 20% down payment is the standard recommendation as it allows you to avoid Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). However, many loan programs allow for much smaller down payments, some as low as 3-5%."
    },
    {
        question: "Is it better to calculate by income or by budget?",
        answer: "Both methods are useful. Calculating by income shows you what lenders might approve you for based on standard rules. Calculating by budget shows you what you are personally comfortable spending each month, which is often the more important number."

                                This calculator starts with your annual income and uses standard Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios to estimate the maximum home price and monthly payment lenders might consider for you. It's a great way to understand your borrowing power.
