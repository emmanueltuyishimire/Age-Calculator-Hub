    { question: "How do I use the baby age calculator by date of birth?", answer: "Simply enter your baby's date of birth into the calculator and click 'Calculate'. The tool will instantly show you their chronological age in multiple formats: years/months/days, total weeks, and total months." },
    { question: "How to calculate baby age in weeks?", answer: "The calculator finds the total number of days since birth and divides by 7 to get the total weeks. The remainder is the number of extra days. This is useful for tracking a newborn's progress." },
    { question: "Is 12 weeks the same as 3 months for a baby?", answer: "Not exactly. A month has about 4.3 weeks on average. So, 12 weeks is a little less than 3 full calendar months. Our calculator shows you both formats to avoid confusion, and the baby age chart below provides a quick reference." },
    { question: "What is corrected age for a premature baby?", answer: "Corrected age (or adjusted age) is your baby's age minus the number of weeks they were born early. For example, a 6-month-old baby who was born 2 months early has a corrected age of 4 months. Doctors use corrected age to assess a preterm baby's development." },
    { question: "Does this calculator work for premature babies?", answer: "This calculator determines the baby's chronological age (actual time since birth). It does not calculate the corrected age. For a premature or preterm baby, you should track both chronological and corrected age, and always follow your pediatricianâ€™s guidance on developmental milestones." },
    { question: "Does this calculator handle leap year birthdays?", answer: "Yes, our algorithm correctly accounts for leap years to ensure the age calculation is always accurate." },
    { question: "Why is tracking baby age in weeks important?", answer: "For the first few months, doctors track developmental milestones and growth by weeks. It's the most precise way to monitor a newborn's progress." },

                           In the first couple of years, a baby's development happens at lightning speed. Using an online age calculator to track their age from their date of birth is important for several reasons:

                            <li><strong>Developmental Milestones:</strong> Knowing your baby's precise age helps you understand if they are on track for milestones like rolling over, sitting up, and talking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feeding Schedules:</strong> A baby's nutritional needs change rapidly. Age in weeks and months often dictates when to introduce solid foods.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> It answers the common confusion between weeks and months. For example, a baby is 3 months old, not at 12 weeks, but after 3 full calendar months have passed.</li>

                           If your baby was born prematurely (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), your pediatrician will likely use a "corrected age" to track their development. Corrected age is the baby's chronological age minus the number of weeks or months they were born early.

                           For example, if your baby is 16 weeks old but was born 4 weeks early, their corrected age is 12 weeks. This adjusted age is used to evaluate developmental milestones because premature babies need time to catch up.

                           This calculator determines the **chronological age** (the time since birth). Always consult your healthcare provider about your premature baby's development based on their corrected age.
