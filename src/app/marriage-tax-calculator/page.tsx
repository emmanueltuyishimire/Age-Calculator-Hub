                            Tax laws generally become more complicated after marriage, but marriage can present some opportunities to save additional money, particularly for those in single-income marriages or marriages in which there is a large difference between the income of the spouses.

                         <p>
                            Conversely, dual-income married couples, especially those with similar high incomes, can experience the "marriage penalty," paying more in taxes than they would as two single individuals. Our calculator helps you estimate where you might stand.
