    {
        question: "What is a statute of limitations?",
        answer: "A statute of limitations is a law that sets the maximum amount of time that parties in a dispute have to initiate legal proceedings. The time limit typically begins from the date of the incident or the date the injury/claim was discovered."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this calculator legally accurate for my state?",
        answer: "No. This calculator provides a simplified, educational estimate based on general data for a limited number of states and claims. It does not account for specific nuances, exceptions (like the discovery rule), or recent changes in law. It is for informational purposes only."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if I miss the statute of limitations deadline?",
        answer: "If you fail to file a lawsuit within the statute of limitations period, the court will likely dismiss your case, and you will lose your right to sue for that claim permanently, regardless of the merits of your case."
    },
    {
        question: "Does the 'discovery rule' affect the deadline?",
        answer: "Yes. The 'discovery rule' is a major exception in many jurisdictions that can toll, or pause, the statute of limitations until the injury or claim is discovered (or reasonably should have been discovered). Our calculator does not account for this complex rule."
    },
    {
        question: "What should I do to find the exact deadline for my case?",
        answer: "You must consult with a qualified attorney licensed in your jurisdiction. Only a legal professional can provide accurate advice based on the specific facts of your situation. This tool is not a substitute for legal advice."

                        <p className="text-muted-foreground">A statute of limitations is a law that prescribes the time limit for bringing a legal action. Once the deadline has passed, the claim is 'time-barred,' and the defendant can have the lawsuit dismissed, regardless of its merits. These laws exist to ensure fairness and prevent the litigation of stale claims where evidence may be lost and memories have faded.</p>
