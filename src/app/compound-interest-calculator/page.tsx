        question: "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?",
        answer: "Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount. Compound interest is calculated on the principal plus the accumulated interest from previous periods, leading to exponential growth."
    },
    {
        question: "How does compounding frequency affect the interest rate?",
        answer: "The more frequently interest is compounded, the higher the effective annual rate (APY) will be for the same nominal rate (APR). For example, a 6% APR compounded monthly results in an APY of 6.17%."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the Rule of 72?",
        answer: "The Rule of 72 is a quick mental shortcut to estimate the number of years it takes to double your money. You divide 72 by the annual interest rate. For example, at an 8% interest rate, your money would double in approximately 9 years (72 / 8 = 9)."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between APY and APR?",
        answer: "APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the nominal yearly interest rate. APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is the effective yearly rate that includes the effect of compounding. This calculator helps you convert between them."

                           Interest is the cost of using borrowed money. While simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, compound interest is interest earned on both the principal and the accumulated interest. This "interest on interest" effect can lead to exponential growth over time.

                            The more frequently interest is compounded within a time period, the higher the interest will be earned on an original principal. The interest rates of savings accounts and Certificate of Deposits (CD) tend to compound annually. Mortgage loans, home equity loans, and credit card accounts usually compound monthly. For this reason, lenders often like to present interest rates compounded monthly instead of annually. For example, a 6% mortgage interest rate amounts to a monthly 0.5% interest rate. However, after compounding monthly, interest totals 6.17% compounded annually. Our compound interest calculator above accommodates the conversion between daily, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual compounding frequencies.
