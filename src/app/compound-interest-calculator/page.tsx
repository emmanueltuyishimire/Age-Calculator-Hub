const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?",
        answer: "Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount. Compound interest is calculated on the principal plus the accumulated interest from previous periods, leading to exponential growth. Our calculator models compound interest."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the contribution timing (beginning vs. end) affect the result?",
        answer: "Making contributions at the beginning of each period gives your money slightly more time to compound, resulting in a higher ending balance compared to making contributions at the end."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the Rule of 72?",
        answer: "The Rule of 72 is a quick mental shortcut to estimate the number of years it takes to double your money. You divide 72 by the annual interest rate. For example, at an 8% interest rate, your money would double in approximately 9 years (72 / 8 = 9)."
    },
    {
        question: "How do taxes and inflation affect my savings?",
        answer: "Taxes on interest gains reduce your net return, slowing down growth. Inflation reduces the future purchasing power of your money. Our calculator includes optional fields for both to give you a more realistic picture of your investment's real value over time."
