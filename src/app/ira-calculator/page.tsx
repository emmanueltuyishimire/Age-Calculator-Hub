    {
        question: "What is the main difference between a Traditional and Roth IRA?",
        answer: "The primary difference is when you pay taxes. With a Traditional IRA, you get a tax deduction on your contributions now and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax money, and your qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free."
    },
    {
        question: "Which IRA is better if my tax rate is higher now than in retirement?",
        answer: "If your tax rate is higher now, a Traditional IRA is often more advantageous because you get a tax deduction when your taxes are highest. This calculator helps visualize that exact scenario."
    },
    {
        question: "Which IRA is better if my tax rate will be higher in retirement?",
        answer: "If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA is usually better. You pay taxes now at your lower rate, and all your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free."
    },
    {
        question: "How does a regular taxable savings account compare?",
        answer: "A regular taxable account has no tax advantages. You contribute with after-tax money, and you also have to pay taxes on the investment gains (interest, dividends, capital gains) each year, which can slow down growth compared to an IRA."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this calculator a substitute for financial advice?",
        answer: "No. This tool is for informational and educational purposes only. It uses simplified assumptions and does not account for all tax laws or individual circumstances. You should consult with a qualified financial advisor for personalized advice."
