        question: "Is this income tax calculator accurate?",
        answer: "This calculator provides a detailed estimate based on the information you provide and the 2024/2025 tax laws. However, it is not a substitute for professional tax software or a certified tax preparer. It does not cover all tax situations and should be used for estimation purposes only."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between a deduction and a credit?",
        answer: "A tax deduction reduces your taxable income, which lowers your tax bill indirectly based on your tax bracket. A tax credit, on the other hand, is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your actual tax liability, making it more powerful."
    },
    {
        question: "Should I take the standard deduction or itemize?",
        answer: "You should choose whichever method results in a larger deduction. This calculator automatically compares your itemized deductions (from inputs like mortgage interest and state taxes) to the standard deduction for your filing status and applies the higher amount."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the federal income tax rate for 2024?",
        answer: "The U.S. has a progressive tax system with seven federal income tax brackets for 2024: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. The bracket you fall into depends on your taxable income and filing status."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use this to estimate my state taxes?",
        answer: "No, this calculator is designed for federal income taxes only. State tax laws vary significantly, and this tool does not account for those differences."

                            <li><strong>Finds Taxable Income:</strong> It subtracts your deduction from your AGI to determine your final taxable income.</li>
                            <li><strong>Applies Tax Brackets:</strong> It calculates your tax liability using the official progressive tax brackets for your selected year and filing status.</li>
                            <li><strong>Applies Credits:</strong> It subtracts applicable tax credits, such as the Child Tax Credit and credits for other dependents, from your tax liability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Estimates Refund/Amount Owed:</strong> Finally, it compares your total tax liability to the amount you had withheld from your paychecks to estimate whether you will receive a refund or owe more.</li>
