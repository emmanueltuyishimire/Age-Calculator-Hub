const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What is the time value of money (TVM)?",
        answer: "The time value of money is the concept that a sum of money is worth more now than the same sum will be at a future date due to its potential earning capacity. This calculator helps you quantify that concept."
    },
    {
        question: "How does this calculator work?",
        answer: "It functions like a 5-key financial calculator (e.g., BA II Plus). You can solve for any one of the five main variables (N, I/Y, PV, PMT, FV) by providing the other four. Just click the tab for the value you want to find."
    },
    {
        question: "Why are Present Value (PV) and payments (PMT) often entered as negative numbers?",
        answer: "In financial calculations, we use cash flow conventions. Money you pay out (like an initial investment or regular payments) is typically entered as a negative number, while money you receive (like a loan amount or a future withdrawal) is positive. This calculator handles that logic for you."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between 'End' and 'Beginning' mode for payments?",
        answer: "'End' mode (ordinary annuity) assumes payments are made at the end of each period, which is standard for loans. 'Beginning' mode (annuity due) assumes payments are made at the start of each period, common for lease payments or retirement contributions."
