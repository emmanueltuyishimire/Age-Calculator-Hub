        question: "What is PITI?",
        answer: "PITI stands for Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance. These are the four main components of a monthly mortgage payment. Our calculator helps you estimate all of them, plus other potential costs like HOA fees."
    },
    {
        question: "How much of a down payment do I need?",
        answer: "While 20% is the traditional recommendation to avoid Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), many conventional loans allow for as little as 3-5% down. FHA loans can be even lower. A larger down payment reduces your loan amount and monthly payment."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between interest rate and APR?",
        answer: "The interest rate is the cost of borrowing the money. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a broader measure that includes the interest rate plus other costs like lender fees and points, giving you a more complete picture of the loan's cost."
    },
    {
        question: "How can I pay off my mortgage faster?",
        answer: "Making extra payments toward the principal is the most effective way. Even one extra payment per year can shave years off your loan. Our <a href='/loan-payoff-calculator' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Loan Payoff Calculator</a> can show you the impact."

                            Amortization is the process of spreading out a loan into a series of fixed payments over time. Each payment you make is split into two parts: interest and principal.
