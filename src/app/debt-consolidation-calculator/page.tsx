    {
        question: "What is debt consolidation?",
        answer: "Debt consolidation is the process of taking out a new, single loan to pay off multiple existing debts. The goal is often to get a lower interest rate, a single monthly payment, and a clear path to becoming debt-free."
    },
    {
        question: "How does this calculator work?",
        answer: "It calculates the total time and interest you'll pay on your current debts with your current payments. It then compares that to the total time and interest you'd pay with the new consolidation loan. This allows you to see if consolidation is financially beneficial."
    },
    {
        question: "What is APR (Annual Percentage Rate)?",
        answer: "APR is the total cost of borrowing money over a year, including the interest rate and any associated fees. Using APR provides a more accurate comparison between different loan options."
    },
    {
        question: "Is consolidating my debt always a good idea?",
        answer: "Not always. It's generally a good idea if you can get a new loan with a lower interest rate than the weighted average rate of your current debts. If the new rate is higher, or if the term is much longer, you could end up paying more in interest over time. This calculator helps you see that trade-off."
    },
    {
        question: "Does this calculator affect my credit score?",
        answer: "No. Using this calculator is for informational purposes only and does not involve any credit checks. Applying for a real consolidation loan, however, will involve a hard inquiry from the lender, which can temporarily lower your credit score."
