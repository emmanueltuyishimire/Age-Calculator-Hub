    {
        question: "What is a money factor?",
        answer: "A money factor is another way of expressing the interest rate on a lease. To convert it to a more familiar APR, multiply the money factor by 2400. For example, a money factor of 0.0025 is equivalent to a 6% APR (0.0025 * 2400)."
    },
    {
        question: "What is residual value?",
        answer: "Residual value is the estimated value of the car at the end of the lease term. It's set by the leasing company and is a key component in calculating your payment, as you are essentially paying for the depreciation below this value."
    },
    {
        question: "How is a lease payment calculated?",
        answer: "A monthly lease payment is made up of three parts: 1) The depreciation fee (the difference between the car's price and its residual value, spread over the term), 2) The finance fee (calculated using the money factor), and 3) Sales tax."
    },
    {
        question: "What does 'capitalized cost reduction' mean?",
        answer: "This is simply the total amount you pay upfront that reduces the price of the car for the lease calculation. It includes your down payment and any net trade-in value."
    },
    {
        question: "Is it better to lease or buy a car?",
        answer: "It depends on your priorities. Leasing typically offers lower monthly payments and lets you drive a new car more often, but you don't build any equity. Buying is more expensive upfront, but you own the car at the end. Use our <a href='/auto-loan-calculator' class='text-primary hover:underline'>Auto Loan Calculator</a> to compare payments."

                            <li><strong>Auto Price:</strong> The negotiated price of the vehicle (MSRP minus any discounts).</li>
                            <li><strong>Lease Term:</strong> The length of your lease in months (e.g., 36 months).</li>
                            <li><strong>Money Factor:</strong> The financing rate for the lease. Ask the dealer for this number. It looks small, like 0.0025.</li>
                            <li><strong>Down Payment & Trade-in:</strong> Any cash or vehicle equity you are putting toward the lease to reduce the capitalized cost.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sales Tax:</strong> The sales tax rate in your state, which is typically applied to the monthly payments.</li>
                            <li><strong>Residual Value:</strong> The car's estimated worth at the end of the lease, expressed as a fixed amount or a percentage of MSRP.</li>
