                            Traditionally, employee pensions are funds that employers contribute to as a benefit for their employees. Upon retirement, money can be drawn from a pension pot or sold to an insurance company to be distributed as periodic payments until death (a life annuity). In many modern instances, the term "pension" is used interchangeably with the term "retirement plan" rather than as a form of it.

                            <p className="text-muted-foreground">This is the traditional pension plan. Employers guarantee employees a defined benefit upon retirement, based on factors like age, earnings history, and years of service. The employer bears the investment risk. Social Security is the most common example of a DB plan in the U.S.</p>

                            One of the biggest pension decisions is whether to take your benefit as a one-time lump sum or as a guaranteed monthly payment for life. A monthly payment provides security against outliving your money, while a lump sum offers flexibility and the potential to leave an inheritance (by rolling it into an IRA). Our first calculator helps you compare the financial outcomes of these two choices based on your investment assumptions.

                           If you choose monthly payments, you often have to decide between a single-life plan and a joint-and-survivor plan. A single-life plan provides a higher monthly payment but stops when you die. A joint-and-survivor plan provides a lower monthly payment but continues to pay a benefit to your surviving spouse. Our second calculator helps you analyze the total lifetime payout of each option to make an informed decision.
