        question: "What is the federal estate tax?",
        answer: "The federal estate tax is a tax on the transfer of property after a person's death. It is levied on the 'taxable estate,' which is the total value of a person's assets minus their liabilities and certain deductions."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the estate tax exemption for 2024?",
        answer: "For 2024, the federal estate tax exemption is $13.61 million per individual. This means an individual can pass on up to $13.61 million without incurring any federal estate tax."
    },
    {
        question: "Does this calculator account for state estate taxes?",
        answer: "No, this calculator is for federal estate tax estimation only. Some states have their own separate estate or inheritance taxes, which often have much lower exemption amounts. You should consult a local professional for state-specific advice."
    },
    {
        question: "Is life insurance part of the taxable estate?",
        answer: "Generally, yes. If you are the owner of the life insurance policy on your own life, the death benefit is typically included in your gross estate for tax purposes."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this calculator a substitute for legal or financial advice?",
        answer: "Absolutely not. This is a simplified estimator for informational purposes only. Estate tax law is extremely complex. You must consult with a qualified estate planning attorney and a financial advisor for personalized advice."
