const faqs = [
    {
        question: "How much money do I need to retire?",
        answer: "A common method is to use the 4% rule. Estimate your desired annual income in retirement and divide it by 0.04 (or multiply by 25). This calculator automates that and also projects your savings growth to see if you're on track."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a 'safe withdrawal rate'?",
        answer: "A safe withdrawal rate is the percentage of your savings you can withdraw each year in retirement with a low probability of running out of money. 4% is a widely used and historically successful rate, but some financial planners now recommend a more conservative 3-3.5%."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a good pre-retirement rate of return to use?",
        answer: "A common estimate for a diversified stock portfolio is 7-10% annually. However, past performance is no guarantee of future results. It's often wise to use a more conservative number, like 5-7%, for planning purposes."
    },
    {
        question: "Does this calculator account for Social Security?",
        answer: "No. The 'Desired Annual Income' should be the amount you need *from your savings*, after accounting for other income sources like Social Security or pensions."
