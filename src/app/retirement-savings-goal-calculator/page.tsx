    {
        question: "How much money do I need to retire?",
        answer: "A common guideline is the '4% rule,' which suggests you need a nest egg 25 times your desired annual income. For example, to withdraw $60,000 a year, you'd need $1.5 million. Our calculator helps you personalize this estimate."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a good retirement savings goal by age?",
        answer: "Fidelity suggests aiming for 1x your salary by age 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, and 10x by age 67. This calculator helps you create a more personalized goal based on your specific desired income."
    },
    {
        question: "Is 7% a realistic return on investment?",
        answer: "A 7% average annual return is a common long-term estimate for a diversified stock market portfolio, adjusted for inflation. However, past performance does not guarantee future results, and your actual returns may vary."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the 4% rule?",
        answer: "The 4% rule is a guideline that suggests you can safely withdraw 4% of your retirement savings in your first year of retirement, and then adjust that amount for inflation in subsequent years, without running out of money for 30 years."
    },
    {
        question: "What should I do if my projected savings are short of my goal?",
        answer: "Don't panic! You can close the gap by increasing your annual contributions, trying to achieve a higher rate of return (which may involve more risk), or adjusting your retirement age or desired income. Speaking with a financial advisor is a great next step."

                        <p className="text-muted-foreground">The "4% Rule" is a widely used guideline in retirement planning. It suggests that you can safely withdraw 4% of your savings in your first year of retirement, and then adjust for inflation each year after, with a high probability of your money lasting for at least 30 years.</p>
                        <p className="text-muted-foreground">This rule helps us calculate your total required nest egg. For example, if you want $60,000 per year in retirement income, you would divide that by 4%:</p>
                        <p className="text-center font-mono p-4 bg-background rounded-md shadow-inner">$60,000 / 0.04 = $1,500,000</p>
                        <p className="text-muted-foreground">This means you'd need a nest egg of approximately $1.5 million to support your desired lifestyle. Our calculator automates this and projects whether your current savings plan is on track to meet that goal.</p>
