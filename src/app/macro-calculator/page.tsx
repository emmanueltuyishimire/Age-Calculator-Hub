const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What are macronutrients (macros)?",
        answer: "Macronutrients are the three main nutrients your body needs in large amounts: protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Each one provides energy (calories) and plays a unique role in bodily functions."
    },
    {
        question: "How are my daily calories calculated?",
        answer: "First, we calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation. Then, we multiply your BMR by an activity multiplier to get your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). Finally, we adjust this TDEE based on your goal (e.g., subtracting calories for weight loss)."
    },
    {
        question: "Why do different goals have different macro ratios?",
        answer: "The ratios are adjusted to support your goal. For muscle gain, protein is increased to aid muscle repair and growth. For weight loss, protein is also kept high to preserve muscle mass while calories are reduced. For maintenance, a more balanced ratio is used."
    },
    {
        question: "How much protein do I really need?",
        answer: "The amount varies. For general health, a common recommendation is 0.8 grams per kg of body weight. For active individuals or those looking to build muscle, this can increase to 1.6-2.2 grams per kg. Our calculator uses these evidence-based ranges."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this calculator suitable for keto or low-carb diets?",
        answer: "This calculator provides standard, balanced macro recommendations. While you can use the calorie estimate as a baseline, you would need to manually adjust the carb and fat percentages to fit a specific diet like keto (which is very low in carbs and very high in fat)."

        term: "Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)",

    },

        term: "Protein",

                        <p className="text-muted-foreground">"Macros" is short for macronutrients, the three main categories of nutrients your body needs to function: protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Unlike micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), your body needs macros in large amounts. Balancing them correctly is key to achieving your fitness goals, whether it's losing fat, building muscle, or maintaining your current weight.</p>
