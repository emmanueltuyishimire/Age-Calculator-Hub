const faqs = [
    {
        question: "How do you calculate annual salary from hourly pay?",
        answer: "A common simple calculation is to multiply the hourly rate by 2080 (40 hours/week * 52 weeks/year). Our calculator refines this by also considering paid holidays and vacation days."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between bi-weekly and semi-monthly pay?",
        answer: "Bi-weekly pay occurs every two weeks, resulting in 26 paychecks per year. Semi-monthly pay occurs twice a month (e.g., on the 15th and last day), resulting in 24 paychecks per year. The paychecks for semi-monthly pay are slightly larger."
    },
    {
        question: "Why are the 'adjusted' figures lower?",
        answer: "The adjusted figures account for paid time off (holidays and vacation). Because you are paid for these days without working, the number of actual working hours/days in the year decreases. This means your effective hourly and daily rate is higher for the time you are actually working."
    },
    {
        question: "What assumptions does this calculator make?",
        answer: "This calculator assumes a standard 52-week year. The 'Unadjusted' column does not account for any paid time off. The 'Adjusted' column factors in the holiday and vacation days you provide as paid, non-working days."
