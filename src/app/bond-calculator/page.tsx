const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What is the difference between clean price and dirty price?",
        answer: "The 'clean price' is the quoted market price of a bond, which does not include any accrued interest. The 'dirty price' (or full price) is what you actually pay; it includes the clean price plus any interest that has accrued since the last coupon payment."
    },
    {
        question: "What is accrued interest?",
        answer: "Accrued interest is the interest that a bond has earned since its last coupon payment but has not yet been paid to the bondholder. When a bond is sold between payment dates, the buyer pays this accrued interest to the seller."
    },
    {
        question: "What is yield to maturity (YTM)?",
        answer: "Yield to maturity is the total return an investor can expect to receive if they hold the bond until it matures. It takes into account the bond's current market price, par value, coupon interest rate, and time to maturity."
    },
    {
        question: "Why would a bond's price be different from its face value?",
        answer: "A bond's price changes based on market interest rates. If market rates are higher than the bond's coupon rate, the bond will sell at a discount (below face value). If market rates are lower, it will sell at a premium (above face value)."
