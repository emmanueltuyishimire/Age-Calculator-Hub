    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

The application will now automatically use this key to power the Biological Age Calculator.

##  monetizing Monetizing with Google AdSense

The site is set up to display ads via Google AdSense. To enable this and start earning revenue, you must configure two things:

1.  **Update Your Publisher ID**:
    - Open the file `src/app/layout.tsx`.
    - Find the AdSense script tag and replace the placeholder with **your own Google AdSense Publisher ID**.

2.  **Authorize Your Site**:
    - Open the `public/ads.txt` file.
    - Replace the placeholder with **your own Google AdSense Publisher ID**. This file is crucial for advertisers to verify that your site is authorized to sell ad inventory.

Once these steps are completed, AdSense will be correctly configured for your site.
